	LAB3D/SDL FAQ
	=============

Q: Why does LAB3D/SDL crash immediately after starting on my Windows 95/98
machine with a page fault in "OPENGL32.DLL" (and possibly "KERNEL32.DLL")?
A: You are probably running Microsoft's slow, old and buggy software OpenGL
implementation. Install display drivers with OpenGL support; your graphics
card or chipset manufacturer should provide them (e.g. through their web
site). Alternatively, use the software renderer.

Q: Why does LAB3D/SDL run slowly on my machine?
A: There are several possible reasons for this. In OpenGL mode, if you don't
have a 3D accelerator, LAB3D/SDL will run very slowly. Similarly, if your
system's OpenGL implementation is not accelerated, LAB3D/SDL will be unable to
make use of 3D acceleration; updating your display drivers may fix
this. Finally, you may be running LAB3D/SDL at an unnecessarily high graphics
resolution; lower it to something like 800x600. Switching to software
rendering will probably help if your OpenGL implementation is
unaccelerated. In software mode, LAB3D/SDL will be a bit slower if it can't
switch to 8 bit colour mode (256 colours). This is a common problem under
Unix.

Q: Why doesn't LAB3D/SDL have a fast software renderer like the original Ken's
Labyrinth?
A: It has now! That said, the OpenGL version works much better on almost any
post-2005 PC.

Q: Why doesn't LAB3D/SDL support Direct3D?
A: Practically every PC that can run Vista or later decently has good enough
OpenGL support, so rewriting the graphics code again doesn't seem worth it.
The software renderer was practically obsolete before I finished it.

Q: Why doesn't LAB3D/SDL have an automap like Doom, Blake Stone or Descent?
A: Because Ken's Labyrinth doesn't have an automap. Besides, you're supposed
to get lost in labyrinths.
