	LAB3D/SDL Usage
	===============

Users of binary packages are provided with scripts "setup" (Linux) and
"setup.bat" (Windows) to run the setup. Alternatively, the "-setup" flag
may be used as described below.

Run the executable file, making sure that the current directory is the
directory in which the data files are residing.

Command-line parameters (these override settings chosen in setup):

-setup			Run setup.
-res <w> <h> <x> <y>	Use <w>x<h> resolution, simulating <x>x<y> 2D screen.
			Note that while w and h are integers, x and y can be
			any floating point numbers >= than 320x200.
-asp <w> <h>		Override aspect correction; <w> and <h> multiply the
			width and height of the 3D viewport; both are
			floating point numbers greater than 0.1.
-win			Run in a window.
-fullscreen		Run in fullscreen mode.
-nearest		No display filtering.
-trilinear		Trilinear display filtering.
-nomusic		Disable music.
-gmmusic		General MIDI music.
-admusic		Adlib emulation music.
-nosound		Disable sound effects.
-sound			Enable sound effects.
-debug			Extended graphics debug output. Only for
			troubleshooting purposes.

To activate cheat codes, the last parameter must be either "snausty" (normal
cheat mode) or "cheaton" (cheat codes use [LSHIFT]-[LCTRL] instead of both
shift keys). Note that cheaters never prosper.

Unrecognised options are ignored.

	Description of options
	----------------------

Input/Set keys
--------------

The "Input" option allows you to choose the input devices to use. You may
choose to use a mouse and/or a joystick (the primary joystick is used). The
keys can be set using the "Set keys" option.

Resolution/Display type
-----------------------

The "Resolution" option determines the size in pixels of the game window if
you are using a windowed display type.

If you are using fullscreen display, the resolution also determines the
resolution of the screen mode used. Specifically, the screen mode chosen is
the lowest-resolution screen mode that has at least the selected
resolution. In other words, if you choose a resolution from the "Fullscreen
resolutions" list, LAB3D/SDL will switch the screen to that resolution when
you run LAB3D/SDL. If you choose a custom resolution, LAB3D/SDL will select
the closest possible resolution, leaving a black border around the game view.

Decreasing screen resolution improves performance at the expense of graphics
quality.

Filtering/Renderer
------------------

Choosing the correct renderer is quite important. If you have 3D accelerated
OpenGL (which usually depends on your graphics drivers), the OpenGL renderer
will draw high quality graphics with optional trilinear filtering (which
improves graphics quality greatly). However, if you do not have 3D accelerated
OpenGL, choosing the OpenGL renderer will cause LAB3D/SDL to run very slowly
and/or crash (especially under Windows 98, which has a buggy software OpenGL
driver).

The software renderer does not support filtering (the setting is ignored), and
is slower than 3D accelerated OpenGL, but runs fine without 3D
acceleration. Use this if you experience problems with OpenGL. Also note that
the software renderer runs in 8 bit colour mode (256 colours). If your display
does not support 8 bit colour or LAB3D/SDL is unable to switch colour depth,
the game will run very slowly.

Music/Effects/Sound channels/Music channels
-------------------------------------------

LAB3D can play music using Adlib emulation (which sounds just like Ken
intended) or General MIDI (which never seems to sound alike on two different
sound cards). The only real reason to use General MIDI music is that it uses
less processing power.

You can play sound effects and music in mono and stereo. Note that the music
was written in mono; it is converted to stereo by randomly panning instruments
(which is the right way to play the music in stereo, because Ken says so).

Cheats
------

You can cheat in LAB3D/SDL by pressing various key combinations. In the
original Ken's Labyrinth, these combinations all contained both Shift keys. If
you have trouble getting these combinations to work, you can choose to use the
left Shift and Ctrl keys instead.

Sound block size
----------------

Decreasing the sound block size decreases sound latency, but increases the
chances of sound glitches. Increase sound block size if you experience
crackling sound, gaps in sound playback or similar problems. Decrease sound
block size if you experience delays between events and the corresponding
sounds.

Texture colour depth
--------------------

The colour depth used by textures in LAB3D/SDL can be changed. Set this to 32
bit for the best display quality. Settings this to 16 bits may improve
performance and decrease memory use. The driver default setting is usually
fastest.

View
----

Ken's Labyrinth was originally written to run on a 4:3 screen at 320x200
or 360x240 resolution. The view settings let you choose how LAB3D/SDL adapts
Ken's Labyrinth to your display.

The aspect ratio of your display can be taken into account in two different
ways. "4:3 view" assumes that your display has a 4:3 aspect ratio. You should
choose this if you are running in fullscreen mode on a 4:3 display and use
screen resolutions with nonsquare pixels (such as 320x200). "Square pixels"
assumes that your display has square pixels. Use this for widescreen displays
and windows.

When scaling the 2D graphics of Ken's Labyrinth to your screen resolution, you
can either choose to scale them to fill the screen with the 360x240 graphics
of Ken's Labyrinth ("Fill screen") or scale them up by the largest integer
factor that fits on screen ("Integer scale"). Integer scale looks better if
you are not using filtering.
