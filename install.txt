	LAB3D/SDL Installation
	======================

	Hardware requirements
	---------------------

LAB3D/SDL requires a machine capable of running Windows or a Unix-like OS
(e.g. Linux) and the Simple DirectMedia Layer.

Recommended system:

- Pentium II or equivalent CPU.
- NVIDIA Riva TNT or better graphics accelerator (with OpenGL drivers).
- 101-key PC keyboard or similar.

Optional features:

- 16-bit sound card.
- MIDI sound.
- Two-button mouse or better.
- Joystick.

	Software requirements
	---------------------

Operating system:	Windows 95/98/Me/XP, Linux, Solaris, BSD, ...
Libraries:		OpenGL 1.2, GLU 1.3, SDL 1.2. Slightly older versions
			of GLU may work.
Compiler:		GCC 3.3 or later recommended. Other compilers may
			require Makefile changes, but should work.
Other utilities:	Makefiles require GNU Make (or compatible) and sh
			(or compatible, e.g. bash) or Microsoft nmake.
Data files:		Ken's Labyrinth v2.1 (Epic Megagames registered),
			Ken's Labyrinth v2.0 (Epic Megagames shareware),
			Ken's Labyrinth v1.1 (Advanced Systems registered) or
			Ken's Labyrinth v1.0 (Advanced Systems shareware).

	Compiling (Unix with OSS support)
	---------------------------------

Run "make" in the source directory.

	Compiling (Windows, GCC)
	------------------------

Run "make -f Makefile.Win32" in the source directory. MinGW 3.1.0 is
recommended for Windows use. You can download MinGW at: http://www.mingw.org/

	Compiling (Windows, Microsoft)
	------------------------------

Run "nmake /f Makefile.MS" in the source directory from a command prompt with
the proper settings for compilation. The supplied Microsoft makefile assumes
that you have Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003, Microsoft .NET Framework SDK
2.0 and Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows XP SP2 (all of which can be
downloaded from Microsoft's web site at the time of writing) installed in the
default installation directories and SDL 1.2.8 installed in C:\SDL-1.2.8. The
.NET Framework SDK command prompt is suitable for compiling LAB3D/SDL. If your
installation paths differ, edit Makefile.MS before compiling. Microsoft's web
site is at: http://www.microsoft.com/

Note that this target is unmaintained as of LAB3D/SDL 3.0.

	Compiling (Unix without OSS support)
	------------------------------------

Run "make -f Makefile.NoMIDI" in the source directory. Note that General MIDI
music is not available if you do this (not much of a loss).

	Installation (not applicable to full download)
	----------------------------------------------

Place the executable file ("ken" in Unix, "ken.exe" in Windows), "ksmmidi.txt"
(if you want to use General MIDI music) and "ken.bmp" in the same directory as
your copy of Ken's Labyrinth. You may give the executable file a different
name if you like. Windows users should not change the extension of the
executable.

	Setup
	-----

Before running the game, it may be a good idea to check the settings by
running the setup routine. If you have a script or batch file named "setup" or
"setup.bat", you can use this to start the setup routine. Otherwise, run the
main program with command-line parameter "-setup".

The setup routine is automatically run if no configuration file is found, so
you can force setup to run the next time you start LAB3D/SDL by deleting
the settings file ("settings.ini").
